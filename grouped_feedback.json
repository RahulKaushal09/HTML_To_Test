The reason was that I didn't notice any unique or good thing in this application which is different from others.  1\u2022 The interface was not friendly and exciting.  2[Main Point] \u2022 For maximum cases his app provides good  things if someone pays and literally telling, there is nothing about payment ! I meant it is not worthy to pay here as other apps like \"Rancho\", \"Marks\" and all other apps are literally gives maximum things free which this app failed to give. In other words this app seems worthless in comparison to other apps available [ And frustration level goes high when we see the purchase option]  I do request you to check other applications which are very famous and provides things free of cost (maximum things)  ( if they can provide, none will purchase for this app, isn't it ? )  and then modify your app and think, what makes your app different than other apps ? For example Providing HC Verma books will not make it unique as it is available everywhere. If someone pays attention to this point  I am sure that will bring more users !  I am a jee aspirant and I understand your feelings.
